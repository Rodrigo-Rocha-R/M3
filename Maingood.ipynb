    "This project implements a traffic simulation model using the Mesa framework. The simulation aims to model the movement of cars within a city grid, incorporating traffic lights and parking spots. The primary goal is to simulate realistic traffic behavior, including car movements, traffic light interactions, and parking dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is built on a 24x24 grid, where each cell can represent different elements such as roads, buildings, parking spots, and traffic lights. Car agents navigate through the grid based on predefined directional coordinates and traffic light states, aiming to reach their target parking spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Car Agents: Simulated cars that move around the grid, following traffic rules and aiming to park in available spots.\n",
    "- Traffic Light Agents: Traffic lights that control the flow of car agents at intersections, switching between red and green states.\n",
    "- Grid Representation: A multi-layer grid that includes buildings, roads, and parking spots.\n",
    "- Visualization: Tools for visualizing the simulation, including the positions of car agents and the states of traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project leverages the Mesa framework for agent-based modeling and includes various components for data collection and visualization to analyze the simulation results."

    "   - **Behavior**: Traffic lights switch between red and green states at regular intervals, managing the movement of car agents and preventing collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grid**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Represent the city layout, including roads, buildings, parking spots, and traffic lights.\n",
    "   - **Structure**: A 24x24 grid where each cell can represent different elements such as roads, buildings, parking spots, and traffic lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - The model initializes the grid, placing buildings, parking spots, directional coordinates, and traffic lights in their respective positions.\n",
    "   - Car agents are created and placed on the grid, ready to navigate the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Movement**:\n",
    "   - Car agents move through the grid based on predefined directional coordinates.\n",
    "   - They obey traffic lights and navigate around buildings to reach their target parking spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traffic Light Control**:\n",
    "   - Traffic light agents manage the flow of car agents at intersections.\n",
    "   - They switch between red and green states at regular intervals, ensuring smooth traffic flow and preventing collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parking Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - Car agents aim to park in available parking spots.\n",
    "   - The model tracks the occupancy of parking spots and updates the status of car agents accordingly.\n",
